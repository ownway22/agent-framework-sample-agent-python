# Agent Framework Sample Agent - Python

This sample demonstrates how to build an agent using Agent Framework in Python with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK. It covers:

- **Observability**: End-to-end tracing, caching, and monitoring for agent applications
- **Notifications**: Services and models for managing user notifications
- **Tools**: Model Context Protocol tools for building advanced agent solutions
- **Hosting Patterns**: Hosting with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK

This sample uses the [Microsoft Agent 365 SDK for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent365-python).

For comprehensive documentation and guidance on building agents with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK, including how to add tooling, observability, and notifications, visit the [Microsoft Agent 365 Developer Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/developer/).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Microsoft Agent 365 SDK
- Agent Framework (agent-framework-azure-ai)
- Azure/OpenAI API credentials

## Working with User Identity

On every incoming message, the A365 platform populates `activity.from_property` with basic user
information — always available with no API calls or token acquisition:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `activity.from_property.id` | Channel-specific user ID (e.g., `29:1AbcXyz...` in Teams) |
| `activity.from_property.name` | Display name as known to the channel |
| `activity.from_property.aad_object_id` | Azure AD Object ID — use this to call Microsoft Graph |

The sample logs these fields at the start of every message turn and injects the display name
into the LLM system instructions for personalized responses.

## Handling Agent Install and Uninstall

When a user installs (hires) or uninstalls (removes) the agent, the A365 platform sends an `InstallationUpdate` activity — also referred to as the `agentInstanceCreated` event. The sample handles this in `on_installation_update` in `host_agent_server.py`:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `add` | Agent was installed — send a welcome message |
| `remove` | Agent was uninstalled — send a farewell message |

```python
if action == "add":
    await context.send_activity("Thank you for hiring me! Looking forward to assisting you in your professional journey!")
elif action == "remove":
    await context.send_activity("Thank you for your time, I enjoyed working with you.")
```

To test with Agents Playground, use **Mock an Activity → Install application** to send a simulated `installationUpdate` activity.

## Sending Multiple Messages in Teams

Agent365 agents can send multiple discrete messages in response to a single user prompt in Teams. This is achieved by calling `send_activity` multiple times within a single turn.

> **Important**: Streaming responses are not supported for agentic identities in Teams. The SDK detects agentic identity and buffers the stream into a single message. Use `send_activity` directly to send immediate, discrete messages to the user.

The sample demonstrates this in `on_message` ([host_agent_server.py](host_agent_server.py)):

```python
# Message 1: immediate ack — reaches the user right away
await context.send_activity("Got it — working on it…")

# Send typing indicator immediately (awaited so it arrives before the LLM call starts).
await context.send_activity(Activity(type="typing"))

# Background loop refreshes the "..." animation every ~4s (it times out after ~5s).
async def _typing_loop():
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(4)
            await context.send_activity(Activity(type="typing"))
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass  # Expected on cancel.

typing_task = asyncio.create_task(_typing_loop())
try:
    response = await agent.process_user_message(...)
    # Message 2: the LLM response
    await context.send_activity(response)
finally:
    typing_task.cancel()
    try:
        await typing_task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
```

Each `send_activity` call produces a separate Teams message. You can call it as many times as needed to send progress updates, partial results, or a final answer.

### Typing Indicators

- Typing indicators show a "..." progress animation in Teams
- They have a built-in ~5-second visual timeout and must be refreshed in a loop every ~4 seconds
- Only visible in 1:1 chats and small group chats — not in channels

## Running the Agent

To set up and test this agent, refer to the [Configure Agent Testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/developer/testing?tabs=python) guide for complete instructions.

### Local Testing Setup For This Repo

This sample is already wired to use `start_with_generic_host.py` as the local entry point:

```bash
uv run python start_with_generic_host.py
```

Use this repo-specific flow to match the official guide:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

1. Create your local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

1. Fill in Azure OpenAI settings in `.env`.

This repo uses `AzureOpenAIChatClient`, so `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` are required for a successful chat response.

Set `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` to the Azure OpenAI resource root, for example `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/`. Do not append `/openai/v1`.

1. For local development, prefer bearer-token testing first:

```bash
# keep these values for local testing
AUTH_HANDLER_NAME=
USE_AGENTIC_AUTH=false

# fetch a delegated token for MCP tools
a365 develop get-token
```

After `a365 develop get-token`, confirm that `.env` contains `BEARER_TOKEN=...`.

1. Start the agent server:

```bash
uv run python start_with_generic_host.py
```

1. Start Agents Playground against the local endpoint:

```bash
./agentsplayground -e "http://localhost:3978/api/messages" -c "emulator"
```

1. Validate the basic scenarios from the testing guide:

- Send `What can you do?` to confirm the agent responds.
- Send `List all tools I have access to` after `BEARER_TOKEN` is populated.
- Trigger an install event and confirm the welcome message appears.

If you want to switch to agentic authentication later, set `USE_AGENTIC_AUTH=true`, set `AUTH_HANDLER_NAME=AGENTIC`, and populate the `CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__*` values from `a365 config display -g`.
